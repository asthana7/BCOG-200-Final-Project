Documentation file (this can be a revision of your existing readme file): An overview/outline/draft of the material that you 
will provide to users to guide them through using your program. Examples of elements to include are:
introduction to the logic ("sales pitch") for your program
names of functions/methods and the parameters that they take
example use cases
if your program takes data as input: the necessary structure of the data to be read, such as:
the format of the datafile
descriptive field names and their required content formatting (e.g. strings, integers)
whether variable names must be included and/or whether fields must be in a specified order, etc.
Python script file: an outline of the functions/classes/methods that you will be constructing. 
Test file: Description of at least one way that a user may test the entire functionality of your program. 
This should be at least a narrative description of what someone would run. If input data are required to run the program, this file should include reference 
to example data that you will be providing to conduct the test.
